task1
Create a program which implements login-structure. We created three methods and three exceptions for this methods.
Login validation we created with for-loop logic, password validation - with method "mathches" and regex. 
In "SignIn" class we implement login validation with our methods and scanner, also we used try/catch construction to
handle with exceptions. 
Test scenario: 
1. Run with Runner; 
2. Input login (e.g. - Nefiley);
3. Input password (e.g. - Qwerty1);
4. Confirm your password.
